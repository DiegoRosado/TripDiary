TripDiary
=========

Why
---
I wanted to learn a little bit of Android, so I look for a project in which I would like to work on. I know there are lots of good Travel/Trip diaries around but I start working on this becasue I wanted to learn, therefore do not expect great code here  :-)

What is TripDiary about?
------------------------
TripDiary for Android is an android app for tracking your trip easily. It uses the GPS, picture, notes and videos to store every little detail of your trip.
I would like to add some exporting features so you can post to your blog just pressing one button, or send an email to your family (to keep the posted) by a gesture in your mobile phone.
At the same time I though it would be nice to export to a doc or a pdf as a trip diary to check now and then.

Done so far
